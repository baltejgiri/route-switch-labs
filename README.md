# Route & Switch Labs

## Overview
This repository is created to document network labs based on routing and switching protocols. All labs are based on Cisco's switch and router images, network emulation "eve-ng" is used to create a virtual network lab. Eve-ng is run on Hypervisor using "Proxmox". Some labs will demonstrate network automation which uses a linux virtual machine hosted on the Proxmox server.

A network bridge is created between eve-ng labs and virtual machines to push automation configuration to the lab. This is a feature in the emulation software like eve-ng and GNS3.

## Purpose
To practice network environment and technologies that are used in real-world networks. The goal for doing labs is simply improve the understanding of network engineering with hands on practice.

## Structure
A lab will have its own directory under main directory *route-switch-lab*. It will contain a logical network diagram, files for configuration as well as other files if any created for network automation.
